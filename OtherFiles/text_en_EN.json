  "about" : "Application name: Hex to Assembly file converter\n\nVersion: 2.0\n\nAuthors: Hugo Merle, Valentin Baudon, Students M1 Promo 2024\nUnder the direction of: Jean-Jacques Meneu\n\nContact: valentin.baudon@isen-ouest.yncrea.fr\nor jean-jacques.meneu@isen-ouest.yncrea.fr\n\nDescription: This application is a way of converting hexadecimal files into their assembler code. Several display options are available, compact to integral.\nA simple upload of the raw .srec file to the interface is enough and it is then possible to download the result on your machine.\n\nWarning: only works for files from micro-controllers using ARM architecture.\n\nAcknowledgments: We want to warmly thank Jean-Jacques Meneu, the project director, for his guidance and his support throughout this project. We are also grateful to the Isen Nantes school for the means made available to us to carry out this project.",
  "HowItWorks" : "This app is a way to convert hex files into their assembly code.\n\nThe operation of the application is simple:\n     1) Click on the 'Download Hex File' button to download the hexadecimal file you want to translate. The contents of your original file should appear in the text box with the header 'Hexadecimal'\n     2) Select the display option that suits you\n\nSeveral display options are available:\n     - Compact: instruction and values\n     - Classic: detailed instruction and values\n     - Integral: binary value corresponding to the instruction, detailed instruction and values\n\n     3) Click on the 'Convert' button. The contents of your original file translated into assembler should appear in the text box with the header 'Assembler'\n\n     If the display obtained does not suit you, select your new display option and click again on the 'Convert' button. The new content obtained should replace the old result.\n\n     4) to download this visual wherever you want on your computer, click on the 'Download Assembly File' button\n\nExample of display according to the selected options\n     - Compact: LSR (immediate): R7, R3, #28\n     - Classic: Logical Shift Right (Immediate): R7, R3, #28\n     - Integral: 0000111100011111: Logical Shift Right (Immediate): R7, R3, #28"
