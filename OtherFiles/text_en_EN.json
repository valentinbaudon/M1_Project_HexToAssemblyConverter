  "about" : "Application name: Hex to Assembly file converter\n\nVersion: 2.0\n\nAuthors: Hugo Merle, Valentin Baudon, Students M1 Promo 2024\nUnder the direction of: Jean-Jacques Meneu\n\nContact: valentin.baudon@isen-ouest.yncrea.fr\nor jean-jacques.meneu@isen-ouest.yncrea.fr\n\nDescription: This application is a way of converting hexadecimal files into their assembler code. Several display options are available, compact to integral.\nA simple upload of the raw .srec file to the interface is enough and it is then possible to download the result on your machine.\n\nWarning: only works for files from micro-controllers using ARM architecture.\n\nAcknowledgments: We want to warmly thank Jean-Jacques Meneu, the project director, for his guidance and his support throughout this project. We are also grateful to the Isen Nantes school for the means made available to us to carry out this project.",
